It is mid-2018. The battle between [[http://ORF.at][ORF]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediathekView][MediathekView]] reached
another dramatic climax. The unholy Austrian broadcasting basterds
locked out the world from their glory. The overall desperate
MediathekView users faced a satanic message with a slightly smell of
sulfur in the air:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS
name matching apasfpd.apa.at found.
#+END_QUOTE

Desperation all around.

As a workaround, [[https://forum.mediathekview.de/topic/1448/orf-funktioniert-via-mediathekviewweb-de-nicht-via-software-schon/12?page=1][hackers from god found workarounds]]. One had to either
modify the spell of forthcoming (the URL) from =apasfpd.sf.apa.at= to
=apasfpd.apa.at=. Or the intonation of the spell could be changed from
=https://= to a less sacred =http://= one.

Sorcerer's apprentices using the UI can do this by deselecting the
demand for "Download sofort starten", switch to the Downloads tab,
call the context menu, select "Download Ã¤ndern", and modify the URL
with their bare hands.

With a big lot of chunks to be demanded, this is a very tedious work,
not worth the time of humans with a minimum level of dignity.

Behold, here comes salvation: use my magic spell which goes like this:

1. In MediathekView, invoke all desired downloads and de-select the
   "Download sofort starten" switch.
2. Close MediathekView.
3. Start the stem from a snake called [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][Python3]] attached to this cable
   here:
   : mediathekview_change_downloads_to_http.py
4. Restart Mediathekview and look out for "Downloads" > "Alle
   Downloads starten".
5. All your desired forthcomings are coming forth to reach highest
   satisfaction.
6. World peace.

This spell was developed on the holy grounds of GNU/Linux. Less
fortunate ground may need some modification you might consider sending
to me.
